slug: about

I’m interested in data, Earth Observation, statistical learning, evolution, biological and theoretical physics, machine learning, food science, and more specifically looking to further explore geospatial analysis, decision support, and adaptive learning.

I am currently employed at Shopify as a Data Scientist, having a blast being part of People Analytics. I previously worked for the Canadian Space Agency, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. Before that, I spent many years playing music and tending bar. I have a B.Sc. in Geology, with most senior-level credits in Physics. I am currently pursuing the Data Science postgraduate certificate from UC Irvine Extension.

In my free time, I enjoy reading (I’m a huge sci-fi nerd!), Crossfit, conversation, cycling, musical exploration, and anything food-related &mdash; from amazing cocktails, weird DIY pickles, to making the perfect pork shoulder. I share this passion with my wife, who runs a wonderful [blog chronicling her culinary experiences](https://squeezemylemon.ca). People I look up to include Frank Zappa, Richard Feynman, J.K. Rowling, Peter Norvig, and Geoffrey Hinton. You can find me on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/leblancfg), [Github](https://github.com/leblancfg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leblancfg1) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/françois-leblanc-07294b106).
