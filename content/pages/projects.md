Here's a short list of projects I've undertaken in the past.

## autocrop.io
[Open source project](https://github.com/leblancfg/autocrop), currently working on API server and self-hosted service. Perfect for profile picture processing for your website or batch work for ID cards, autocrop will output images centered around the biggest face detected.

## Bayesian Inference Study Group
Put together this little website to serve as a backdrop for a series of study group sessions organized internally for public servants across the Canadian Government. We are currently follwing John Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis textbook, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition.
