    "* How the code closely resembles 'whiteboard-like' pseudocode\n",

    "From Wikipedia:\n",
    ">Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008. It was designed to rectify certain fundamental design flaws in the language (the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number). The guiding principle of Python 3 was: \"reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">Python 3.0 broke backward compatibility, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python's dynamic typing combined with the plans to change the semantics of certain methods of dictionaries, for example, made perfect mechanical translation from Python 2.x to Python 3.0 very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a long adaptation period for the Python community to adapt to the latest version but as of writing, these days are mostly over, and the majority of Python users and active codebases are written for Python 3.X and can make full use of its better performance and new features; even though there was a break in backwards compatibility between Python 2 and 3, there is no such break in sight for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, many books, blog posts, Stack Overflow answers and training videos still contain legacy Python code, and the modern Python user needs to understand a few differences between the two versions to [\"translate\" the material](http://www.w3resource.com/python/python-2-vs-3.php). Here are the main three items to look out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Print statement vs function:\n",
    "    - Python 2: `print 'a'`\n",
    "    - Python 3: `print('a')`\n",
    "* Integer division:\n",
    "    - Python 2: `4 / 3 == 1`\n",
    "    - Python 3: `4 / 3 == 1.333333`\n",
    "* Dictionary access:\n",
    "    - Python 2: `dict.iteritems()`\n",
    "    - Python 3: `dict.items()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from that, the main take-home is: **don't worry about it, and just use the latest version of Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the CSA Data Acquisition team codebase, it is currently running on a \"bilingual\" version that can run on both versions (2.7 and 3.6 as of writing), with the help of a [package called six](https://pythonhosted.org/six/) (named because \"two and three make six\"). This decision was made in order to accomodate some computers with only Python 2.7 being installed. As we have physical access to all of the team's computers, and there is little need to run the code elsewhere, it is my humble opinion that legacy Python should be flushed out of all its computers, and up-to-date versions of Anaconda be maintained. After which, the \"bilingual\" development can be dropped, and further work can be focused on 3.6+ Python, and be able to use the features and performance gains from using modern Python."

For example, installing the [OpenCV package for computer vision](http://opencv.org/) typically requires half-a-dozen steps and compiling files outside of the \"main\" Python folders.
