    <h1 class="entry-title">About</h1>
    
    <p>I’m interested in data, statistical learning, evolution, biological and theoretical physics, neural networks, food science, and more specifically looking to further explore geospatial analysis, generative algorithms, and adaptive learning.</p>
<p>I am currently employed at Environment and Climate Change Canada as a Physical Scientist. I previously worked for the Canadian Space Agency and Transport Canada. Before that, I spent many years playing music and tending bar. I have a B.Sc. in Geology from the University of Ottawa, with many senior-level credits in Physics. I am currently pursuing the Data Science postgraduate certificate from UC Irvine Extension. I would like to apply for a graduate program in a related field sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading (I’m a huge sci-fi nerd), rock climbing, conversation, cycling, musical exploration, and of course anything food-related, from amazing cocktails, weird DIY pickles, to making the perfect pork shoulder. People I look up to include Frank Zappa, Richard Feynman, J.K. Rowling, Peter Norvig, and Geoffrey Hinton. You can find me on Kaggle, facebook, <a href="https://github.com/leblancfg">github</a>, and linkedin.</p>
